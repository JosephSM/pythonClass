### Class 1
Outline:
1. [Scratch](#scratch)
2. [Setting up python](setting-up-python-and-package-managers)
	* [Linux, Unix or Mac OSX](#*nix-operating-systems-such-as-linux,-unix,-mac-osx)
	* [Windows](#windows)
3.[Homework](#homework)
#### Scratch 
To start getting our heads to think more programmatically, we will start with scratch, a free software built to learn the ideas behind coding from the great people at MIT. linked [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

To start, I would advise you to create a project and play around.

If you get stuck, MIT put out a couple tutorial videos [here](https://scratch.mit.edu/help/videos/#)

While playing around, it is advised to use blocks from the control section, this will help you create more powerful animations.

#### Setting up python and package managers
##### *nix operating systems such as linux, unix, mac osx
Before you start, you may want to read up on a bash primer, or just learn the basic commands.

here is a [bash reference](http://ss64.com/bash/). Of course you do not have to know all of them, but some of them you will use more then others, such as: cd, ls, mkdir, find.

Python usually comes installed on these operating systems. To check, open your applications and search for terminal. Once it is opened type

```sh
python --version
```
You should see something like: 2.7.11

If not, you can download python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)


Google has put out a setup page for python also, linked [here](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/set-up?hl=en)

For mac, a great package manager to have is [homebrew](http://brew.sh/), download and instalation is advised.
##### Windows
Before you start, we will be using the command line, so reading up on a command line [reference](http://ss64.com/nt/) is advised. You don't need to learn all the commands, just some of the more useful ones (such as cd, dir, find, help, md, move, path)

You can test to see if python is install on your machine opening the cmd application and typing: python --version 

if you dont get back a version such as: 2.7.11, then you need to download and install it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
