            <p> This website was created to help users navigate through the class I put together. You are more than welcome to use all the material here for free for whatever purpose you desire. I will gladly take feedback on how to create a better course for students to learn programming. Thank you. You can visit my other site <a href="http://kennethgoodman.github.io/">Here</a>.
